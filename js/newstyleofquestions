23 equations
Each can be represnted by a number
1 = [1, 2, 3] // Kinetic Energy
Where each item in the list represents a variation of the equation
2 = [1, 2]
...

Equations = [[1,2,3], [1,2], [1,2,3]]
etc...

When equations are chosen, a duplicate of the list is made.
Then randomly selects, promps and delets each index of the "linked list"?.
Once there is nothing in the Equations list the questions are over.
